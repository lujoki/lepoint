Power management

Now the real deal: how to maximize battery operation and lifetime with the Lenovo Thinkpad X300?

The average base power consumption is 14 W, WiFi on, 75% backlight, some terminals and Firefox.

First, disable everything you will never use in the BIOS. Currently, I disabled Bluetooth, WiMAX, Wireless WAN (3G),"USB Wifi" (wtf?) and touchpad. Saving: 2 W

Then disable Wake On Lan, unless you need it. It keeps the Gigabit Ethernet Controller to remain in an active state that actually use energy. Saving: 1W

Moreover, I blacklisted the e1000e module, since I mainly use WiFi. When I need wired connection, I simply modprobe it.

Then concerning the wlan0 WiFi interface, just run:

iwconfig wlan0 power on
in order to active Power Management. Saving: 0.5W

Some sysctl tweaking in /etc/sysctl.conf:

vm.laptop_mode = 5  # Activating laptop mode, power friendly I/Os
vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs = 2000
kernel.nmi_watchdog = 0
vm.swappiness = 5
And in /etc/rc.local:

echo 10 > /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save
echo min_power > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/link_power_management_policy
echo min_power > /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/link_power_management_policy
Saving: 2W

Quite simple, heh? :) Now, my average consumption is 8.8W, allowing a real use of the X300 for more than 6 hours, instead of 4h30.

Last thoughts

The internal fan management is kinda broken in Linux. The workaround is to append thinkpad_acpi to /etc/modules and options thinkpad_acpi fan_control=1 to /etc/modprobe.d/fan for instance.

Then you could use thinkfan and this sample thinkfan.conf:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# thinkfan example config file
# ============================
#
# Syntax:
# (LEVEL, LOW, HIGH)
#
# LEVEL is the fan level that's written to /proc/acpi/ibm/fan
# LOW is the temperature at which to step down to the previous level
# HIGH is the temperature at which to step up to the next level
# All numbers are integers.
#
# You can put spaces anywhere you want. Anything that doesn't match this
# syntax is ignored.
#
# The number of tuples is limited by the size of your system memory.
#
# WARNING: Sanity checks are only made for correct ordering of the fan levels
# and for (LOW < HIGH) within one tuple. You can still use any kind of insane
# temperature limits.

Concerning lithium batteries, you should keep them charged between 40% and 80%. It is quite easy to do with Thinkpads: just append tp_smapi to /etc/modules, and the upper charge limit will be set to 86%, which is a good compromise. Moreover, instead of completely drain the Ultrabay battery before switching to the main battery, you can manually force discharge; as root type:

echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/force_discharge
But do not forget that even if you replug your laptop, discharge will resume anyway! 
Thus, you have to bypass forced discharge; as root type:

echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/force_discharge
Annoying workaround, but I will try to find or code a proper solution.
